# Hi there üëã, I'm Firoj Hosen
### Web Developer
## Identity

I am a Full Stack Web Developer, whose journey began with a deep love for technology. To me web development is not just a job - it's a kind of art and a problem to solve the problem. I learn something new every day, create something new, and try to make the world a little easier through my code.

I was interested in technology since childhood. In the beginning, I started learning how to create curiously the website. Then gradually I am working as a professional web developer to learn CSS, Javascript, PHP, Mysql, etc.

### My web development journey
Initial step
At first I could just create a static website. Then I learned how to build a webpage structure with HTML and make the webpage beautiful with CSS. I realized how attractive it is to make a simple page with design and styling.
Lead
Then I thought it would have been even better if the website could interact with the user. Then I started learning javascript. Javascript taught me how to make a website dynamic - I learned to create everything in click event, form validation, slider, modal, etc.

But that I didn't stop. I started to learn PHP and MySQL‡•§ Through this I was able to create a database-driven website. To create features of login system, registration system, product management, etc., I realized that the website can be used not only to show information, but also to solve real -life problems.
#### Full Stack Development
By working on both front and back end - I gradually become a full stack developer. I learned how to create a project from beginning to end.
I also learn Python, which helped me make web scraping, data analysis and automation projects. Besides, I have gained the ability to create mobile applications using DART and Flutter.

### My skills....
#### Front end....
HTML5, CSS3, Javascript (ES6+)
Responsive design, tailwindcss, bootstrap
React.js (at the level of learning)

#### Backend....
Php & mysql
Rest API Development
Authentication Systems
Database Design & Optimization

#### Other language....
Python (automation, web scraping, data analysis)
Java (Basic Application Development)
dart (flutter for mobile apps)

#### Tool......
Git & github
Vs code, phpstorm
Figma (UI/UX Design Preview)

### My project experience
**1. User Authentication System**
*Challenge:* Keep user data safe and ensure proper validation.
*Solution:* I created a custom authentication with PHP & MySQL, where the password was washed with BCRPT.
*Impact:* Secure login and registration system has been created, which is also reusable in other projects.

**2. Chat Application**
*Challenge:* Real-time data update.
*Solution:* I made real-time chat using AJAX with PHP and JavaScript. Later I integrated websoket with Python.
*Impact:* Tim has been a great project for communication and practice.

**3. E-Commerce website**
*Challenge:* Product Management, Order System, User Authority.
*Solution:* I created the entire front end and backnd, with the cart system and the payment gateway.
*Impact:* A practical solution of the real e-commerce model stands.

4. Screen Recording Application
Challenge: Recording your job and preserving project demo.
Solution: I made a custom screen recorder with Python.
Impact: Now I can easily record my job and use it as evidence or as a tutorial.

**5. Social Media website**
*Challenge:* Profile, post, comment, Like System implement.
*Solution:* Created a basic social media platform with PHP, MySQL and Javascript.
*Impact:* I have had a great experience on social media core features.

### The visit to my work
I believe that the biggest feature of a good developer is the ability to solve the problem. Coding can be learned, but if you have the mentality of finding a solution by going deep into the problem, one can become a real developer.

I always try to write a clean code - so that someone else can easily understand. Besides, I emphasize security, scalable and performance.

### Future
Working with international clients.
Creating web apps on a large scale.
Integrating web development with Ai and Machine Learning.
To teach and inspire new developers.

#### Conclusion
I am a Passionate Web Developer, who finds something new in each code. I do not just create functional solutions through my projects, but also to create something that can bring about real changes in people's lives.
